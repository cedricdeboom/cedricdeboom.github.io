_The Lark Ascending_ is probably one of the most beautiful pieces of classical music for violin and accompaniment. The piece, written by Ralph Vaughan Williams (yes, you should pronounce that as 'Rafe'), is inspired on a poem by George Meredith. From the first notes on, the piece gets you soaked into the lark's lyrics and the atmosphere of the English countryside.

The piece is mostly (if not, almost exclusively) heard in an orchestral rendition, with a solo violin part. The first performance of it, however, was in 1920, in a rendition for violin and piano! There exist almost no recordings of this first version. Luckily in 2012 the BBC recreated and recorded that first performance:
