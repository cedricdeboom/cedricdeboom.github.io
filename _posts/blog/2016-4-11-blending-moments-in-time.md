For those who do not know **Elia Locardi**, go [check him out](https://500px.com/elialocardi){:target="_blank"} on 500px. He is a professional landscape and cityscape photographer who has inspired me ever since I have gotten interested in photography. His point of focus is to photograph famous landmarks in the world in such a way that no-one has seen it before. His landscapes are so vivid and spectacular and the colours in his photos really pop out. He also developed a technique called _'blending moments in time'_. In short, he takes multiple of pictures of his subject as time progresses and then he blends the best aspects of these pictures into one blend. For example, he takes pictures all the way from the golden hour, through sunset and blue hour, and afterwards he combines the most dramatic sky of the sunset with artificial lights that have come on during the blue hour. Really, go and check his photos out and you will see what I mean.

Inspired by his pictures and his moment blending style, I decided to give it a try myself. The city of Ghent in Belgium is my current home base, and it is the ideal spot to try out new photographic techniques. The city centre - although many landmarks are [fake or rebuilt](http://www.schamper.ugent.be/476/schampers-architectuurgids-1){:target="_blank"} - is very photogenic as it is home to a lot of medieval houses, churches, towers, canals and castles. For this project I decided to take a picture of the famous **'Graslei'**, which in the summer is _the_ hotspot for tourists and the operating base of many boating companies. Below is a blue hour picture of the Graslei I found on Flickr.

Let's tackle this. I waited a long time for the perfect evening (it has been overcast and raining a lot these days), and finally it came. The colours in the sky were really amazing: a mix of oranges, reds and purples. And there were some clouds, so this could be the perfect shot. However, I came too late to the spot I picked out. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the clouds were mostly gone. I really have to come earlier to scout the location, pick my favourite spot and set up the camera. That's the first take-home lesson. Still, the colours in the sky were quite beautiful, and after shooting for a while some clouds returned. This is the base sunset shot I picked (unedited).

Maybe it is a good time to point to my camera settings. I shoot with my EOS1100D in RAW and AV mode. That way I can enable exposure bracketing; I shoot three exposure brackets, and the picture above is the +0EV image. The lens I use is the amazing Sigma 17-50mm \(f\)/2.8 with image stabilization.

The image above is quite underexposed for the subject, but I do not have any blown out sky in which there is still a lot of detail and colour. Above that, Capture One 9 (my RAW processor) does an amazing job at recovering shadows, which is a process people used to avoid as much as possible, but is not much of an issue anymore with the current camera sensors and RAW processors. On the sides of the picture there are some annoying elements, so I slightly crop the image. My resulting balanced RAW is shown below.

</figure>

Some time later it becomes darker at the Graslei and more lights come on, of which I also take some pictures. As I know the location, I knew that after a while no more lights would come on, so I did not wait for the blue hour. The camera did not move in the entire process! This is the cropped and balanced resulting RAW image. Note that the sky is not that colourful and interesting as before.

</figure>

Now we want to blend both images so that the artificial lights from the second RAW are brought into the first RAW image. Then we have nice looking lights on the buildings together with a rather interesting sky. In Photoshop this is done by choosing the _'Lighten'_ blending mode, so that only the lighter parts of an image shine through. At this point I also decided to remove all people in the scene using the clone stamp - prepare for at least one hour of work! This is the resulting image.

Let's make this image vivid. I first correct the perspective distortion as the towers on the side now look skewed. Then I fire up _Color Efex Pro_, which is a plug-in part of Google's [Nik Collection](https://www.google.com/nikcollection/){:target="_blank"}, and which is now totally free! I added Pro Contrast, Tonal Contrast and Contrast Color Range, and the result is shown below. There is now more contrast and color separation between the colors in the sky, and there is also more contrast in the buildings.

</figure>

Finally we do some selective sharpening using a high pass filter on the buildings through a mask. In the water and the sky I apply a Dfine effect (also part of Color Efex Pro) to reduce the noise. I also fix some of the reflections in the water with the clone stamp since there are still some people visible. Finally I apply a slight purple photo filter to the sky and the water, and I add some overall contrast. The final result is shown below.

This was my first experiment with blending moments in time. If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to post them below!


<!-- 
As I had to make a report for my photography class, I took my camera with me all the time. I was too distracted by the presentations, posters, receptions... so I did not take that many pictures. I had the following gear in my backpack:

* Canon EOS 1100D camera body (very basic model, crop sensor, only usable up to ISO 1600),
* Canon EF-S 18-55mm \\(f\\)/3.5-5.6 (no IS),
* Canon EF-S 10-18mm \\(f\\)/4.5-5.6 (with IS),
* Canon EF 50mm \\(f\\)/1.4 (no IS),
* Canon EF 70-300mm \\(f\\)/4-5.6 (no IS).

As with my trip to New York City, I did not bring flashes or a tripod, since I did not want to disturb anyone or devote too much time setting up the camera. The pictures should be more like snapshots instead of well-considered ones. The images below are only slightly edited in Adobe Lightroom; click on them to enlarge.

We arrived in Montréal two days before the start of the conference, so we had some time to explore the city. I immediately noticed that the French language is alive and kicking over there, as is the love for France, shown by this underground sign which you would normally encounter in the centre of Paris.

The following picture also shows that the main language on almost all signs in the city and its restaurants is still French. 'Le très hot chicken' served with _poutine_: "a Canadian dish, originating in the province of Quebec, made with french fries and cheese curds topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce" [Wikipedia].

Next we went to the McGill University site and climbed up to the top of the Mount Royal (_'Mont Réal'_).

This time of year the temperatures are normally much below zero degrees celcius, but we were lucky, as we had 5 to 10 degrees throughout the entire week. Still, it is obvious that winter usually poses severe conditions on the local vegetation.

The conference itself kicked off with a packed auditorium for the deep learning tutorial by Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. It was very, very dark inside, so I had to zoom in to about 250mm to get the two in the picture. Still my shutter speed was too low to get a sharp image... The tutorial was not that interesting: if you already knew things about certain topics, you did not learn anything new; if you were unfamiliar with other topics, you were lost in the explanation.

The conference was held in the Palais de Congrès on the edge of Old Montréal, a huge building on top of the highway tunnel with a colourful facade.

The first conference day concluded with a poster session with more than 100 posters and a walking dinner. It was so crowded people got nearly crushed by each other. Later we heard that this NIPS edition broke records: more than 3,800 attendees this year!

The following days there were mostly talks during the day, which were often pretty boring. Bad speakers, thoughtless slide designs, lacking enthusiasm... I admit, the auditorium was extremely large, which makes it almost impossible to interact with the audience. The screens were also very far from the speaker, so that he or she could not interact with the slides in an effective way.

On the evening of the second day there were again posters and demonstrations. Two of my colleagues gave a very succesful demo of our platform [_DIANNE_](http://dianne.intec.ugent.be){:target="_blank"} (for which I designed the logo). It is a JAVA- and OSGi-based internet-of-things library to distribute neural networks at runtime across devices.

On the two last days there were workshops. Some were overly crowded, such as the RAM workshop and the Deep Reinforcement Learning workshop. The father of reinforcement learning, Richard Sutton, was even denied access to the room[^1]!

NIPS was quite an experience, a lot of people - including big names - a lot of posters, a lot of workshops, a lot of pushing and shoving, a lot of networking, a lot of receptions... Maybe next year again!
