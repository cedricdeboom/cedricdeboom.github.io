## Research interests and activities
My main research interests are diverse. At the highest levels I am interested in **information retrieval** and data mining theoretics and applications. I started with some projects and a master's thesis in **Hidden Markov Models** and **imprecise probability theory** in speech and text processing[^1], and I also did a project on **music information retrieval**. But for my PhD[^2] I went to **social media text mining**. Very quickly I began to look at **deep learning** techniques since, according to literature, this seemed the way to further advance the field of **natural language processing**. Next to that I am also interested in applications in **recommendation systems** and **education**. Currently I am working on the topic of **short text similarity** of Twitter posts using word embeddings. I have counseled master's dissertations on the topic of popularity prediction in Twitter, place recommendations using social media, and large-scale sentiment classification of Twitter posts using Hadoop.
